- Added a bit of code to clear the ID of deleted items, so subsequent saves will actually create new items.

**1.0.0.2029** *(May 26, 2018)*

- Fixed the display string in the location base class, so it won't have an empty Long/Lat if there is no long/lat.

**1.0.0.2028** *(May 22, 2018)*

- Removed the token label stuff. You know what? It's too complicated for this level, and is better left to the higher-level implementation.

- Made sure that getting an element's access object is bottlenecked properly.

**1.0.0.2005** *(April 12, 2018)*
